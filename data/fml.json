In the span of an hour, she was hit on more than I ever have been in my life. FML\n","\nTodaymy elderly neighbor along with our community church's priest came to my house and demanded to give them the girl\". The girl is my 3-year-old daughter, who has natural born red irises and is photo-sensitive. And yes, we are also Romanian. FML\n","\nInsane parents\nTodayI was wondering why the new book series I'd ordered hadn’t arrived. I ordered new books because my mom constantly bitched at me about being on the internet too often. She took my laptop away to teach me a lesson\". Only I need my laptop to get the confirmation number to track my books. FML\n",
"\nTodayI found out what happens when you sleep with a girl your chemistry major friend likes. He put silver nitrate in my body wash and shampoo.

FML\n","\nTodayI learned how unhappy my husband is in our marriage. Apparently he also can't find a good woman. We didn't have a heart-to-heart, I read his woes in a blog. FML\n","\nTodayI was at a restaurant with my boyfriend. I look him straight in the eye and ask him: What's the first thing you think about when you look at me?\". His answer: \"Can I finish my steak?\" FML\n","\nTodayI witnessed a large woman pee on a pregnancy test in the middle of a Walmart parking lot, clean herself off, then wander around with the test hanging out of her mouth, waiting for her result. Where in the name of Christ do these people come from? FML\n","Todayinstead of staying home, I took an hour-long bus ride in the middle of the night to my girlfriend's place because on the phone she said, I desperately need your body right now\". It turned out she was just cold. She is also on her period. FML ","\nTodayI thought I was going on a date. About 20 minutes into it, after giving her my arm to hold (like a true gentleman) it came up in conversation that my brother is gay. Her response: oh, so both you and your brother are gay?\" FML\n",
"\nTodaymy flight was at the other side of the airport. I ran to the gate, to find that the flight had moved to the other side of the airport. So I ran again to miss my plane by a minute.

When the man thanked me I accidentally said, \"I love you too.\" FML\n","TodayI've had no sleep. Why? Because my housemate has a new girlfriend and the walls are too thin. After round three of them shagging, I was exhausted from holding my breath each time the new girlfriend screamed. I also realised that was the closest I'd been to sex in months. FML ","\nTodaymy psychotic step-dad asked me if I'm doing drugs. I replied with a massive amount of sarcasm: Yeah, all of 'em. Especially meth.\" He flipped out, searched my room top to bottom, then grounded me \"for good\" until I tell him where I hid the supposed drugs. FML\n","\nTodaymy beloved pet chicken ran away from home. I got so distraught that my dad offered to buy me dinner. Specifically, KFC. FML\n","\nTodayduring dinner, my mum asked why I've been so upset recently, so I just admitted it was because my girlfriend had cheated on me.

FML\n","\nTodaymy mother-in-law announced that she's going to be moving into the apartment next to us. Oh joy. FML\n","\nTodayI bit into a barbecue-ed corn cob, forgetting I had a filling on my chipped front tooth. I re-chipped it. FML\n","\nTodayI played paintball with a bunch of friends. By the end of the day, my girlfriend and I were the only people left on the field. She shot me mercilessly, and I screamed like a little girl. 30 people watched, 4 people filmed. FML\n","TodayI finally had the opportunity to have sex with my girlfriend. This would be the first time for both of us, so I tried to make it really special. I had everything planned out to be very romantic. She loved how it was set up. After all this, I couldn't get it up at all, all night. FML ","\nTodayI visited a waterpark with friends. At one point, a woman floating near me suddenly says to me, How are you doing, honey?\" Instinctively, I replied, \"I'm well\". The woman gave me a strange look and I turned around to find she was talking to her child directly behind me.

FML\n","\nTodayI got back from a 6 month deployment overseas. My girlfriend of 3 years couldn't pick me up from the airport because she had an intramural softball game to go to.

FML\n","\nTodayI parked in my employee of the month\" parking spot by the front of the store and started my shift.

FML\n","\nTodayI'm on a train, feeling good because I got upgraded to first class. The man opposite me just slid me a note saying, Wee plooky cunt, fuck off!\" Charming. FML\n","\nTodayI shared an elevator alone with an attractive co-worker. On our way up, she let out a loud, noxious rip.

FML\n","TodayI told my parents that I wanted a little brother. My dad apparently thought it would be funny to tell me that my mom just swallowed my little brother. FML ","\nTodayafter ordering a custom $200 Valentine's Day gift box for my husband, he gave it away to a female coworker upon delivery because Valentine's Day isn't for guys. I hope she like the new Xbox one controller and all the gift cards as well. FML\n","\nTodayI was watching Ratatouille.

Now go to sleep!\" FML\n","\nTodaymy father took me out for some driving lessons. I accidentally reversed while still in the driveway, and I instinctively hit the brakes.

Don't flatter yourself.\" FML\n","\nNot so specialTodaythe guy I've been dating and sleeping with told me he is also dating another woman, but that they only kiss.

A group came in for tickets but wanted to pay individually. One paid $40 for a $25 ticket.

FML\n","\nTodayI had to give a deposition ahead of a trial in which my former boss is accused of fraud. I'm not a smart man, and I smoked a joint before heading out to try to calm my nerves. I got way too high and ended up giggling like an idiot through half the deposition. FML\n","\nTodayon the brink of a stiflingly hot summer, I've come to a terrible realisation.
